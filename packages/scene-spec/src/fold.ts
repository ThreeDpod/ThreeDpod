/**
 * Event-folded scene state: the head revision derived from an ordered log.
 *
 * The event log is the authority; this module is how every reader agrees on
 * what it says. Given the same ordered sequence it always returns the same
 * head — a pure function over an array, no clocks, no randomness, no store.
 * It follows `foldJobs` (`packages/shared/src/job-state.ts:153`) in shape:
 * walk once, accumulate, resolve the phase (here: the head) at the end.
 *
 * Input shapes are owned here, not in `@nap/shared`. M2 maps them onto the
 * `NapEvent` union for transport; until then the fold is testable without the
 * event system, which is exactly what lets M1 stay runtime-free.
 *
 * Rules, in application order per event:
 * - `scene.rejected` carries diagnostics, not state — always ignored.
 * - `scene.updated` must verify three ways or it is skipped: the spec parses,
 *   its canonical hash equals the claimed `specHash`, and it links — null
 *   parent starts a chain, otherwise `parentHash` must name a seen revision.
 *   A skipped entry never bricks the fold; later valid entries still apply.
 * - Redelivery is idempotent: an update whose hash already heads the fold is
 *   a no-op. Two different specs off one parent resolve by order — later in
 *   the sequence wins. Both properties fall out of content addressing rather
 *   than special casing, and both are pinned by tests.
 * - `scene.reverted` resolves `toHash` against seen revisions and moves the
 *   head; unknown hashes are skipped. Revert adds no revision — history is
 *   preserved because nothing is ever removed.
 *
 * Deliberately not here (runtime responsibilities, documented for M2/M3):
 * authoritative acceptance under a lease, exactly-once execution (the system
 * does not guarantee it — idempotent redelivery plus content-hash dedupe is
 * what it does guarantee), cross-process ordering beyond `seq`, and truncated
 * windows (a fold starting mid-log has no genesis; that needs a snapshot
 * event, a future extension, not a silent rebase).

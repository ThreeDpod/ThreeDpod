/**
 * Scene tools' shared logic: reading the folded head and applying proposals.
 *
 * Both tools answer from the same authority — the event log folded by
 * `foldSceneSpec` — so `get_scene` can never describe a scene that
 * `propose_scene_patch` would reject as stale, except across the one boundary
 * that matters: appends still in flight. A turn's own accepted proposals land
 * in the caller-owned overlay (`sceneState`) first and reach the store through
 * the normal emit path, so a second proposal in the same turn validates against
 * the first one's result rather than racing its append.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the store, the bus, or a `seq`. Reading history and
 * emitting events are the caller's jobs (injected as `readSessionEvents` and
 * `emit`); this module maps between the two and speaks only in validated
 * results. An invalid stored event cannot corrupt the fold — triple
 * verification runs at the boundary on every read, not just on write.
